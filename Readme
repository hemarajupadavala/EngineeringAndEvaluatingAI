# Email Classification Project

This project implements a hierarchical multi-output classifier for categorizing emails based on their content. It uses machine learning techniques to classify emails into multiple levels of categories.

## Files in the Project

- `AppGallery.csv`: Dataset containing email data from the App Gallery domain.
- `Purchasing.csv`: Dataset containing email data from the Purchasing domain.
- `hierarchical.py`: Main script implementing the hierarchical classification model.
- `ImplementationOfChainedOutputs.py`: Script implementing the chained outputs classification approach.

## Prerequisites

Before running the scripts, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.7+
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- nltk
- imblearn
- xgboost
- textblob

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn nltk imblearn xgboost textblob
```

## Running the Scripts

### Hierarchical Classification

To run the hierarchical classification model:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the following command:

```bash
python hierarchical.py
```

This script will:
- Load and preprocess the data from both CSV files.
- Train a hierarchical multi-output classifier.
- Evaluate the model's performance on a test set.
- Display the results, including accuracy for each classification level.

### Chained Outputs Classification

To run the chained outputs classification model:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the following command:

```bash
python ImplementationOfChainedOutputs.py
```

This script will:
- Load and preprocess the data from both CSV files.
- Implement a chained multi-output classifier.
- Train the model and make predictions.
- Display detailed results for each email instance in the test set.
- Show the overall accuracy of the model.

## Results

Both scripts will output their results to the console. The hierarchical model will show accuracy scores for each level of classification, while the chained outputs model will display detailed predictions and accuracy for each email instance in the test set.

## Customization

You can modify the scripts to experiment with different machine learning algorithms, feature engineering techniques, or hyperparameters. Feel free to adjust the code to suit your specific needs or to improve the model's performance.
